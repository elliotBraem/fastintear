# wallet adapter widget

This package currently contains adapters for:

  - MyNEARWallet (primary focus)
  - Meteor Wallet (low-detail focus)
  - Here Wallet (low-detail focus)

We don't have to have these adapter in this project, but the decision was made to keep it here for the sake of relentless shipping. We will establish a working save point, and can refine the structure of this package and project accordingly.

The lion's share of focus has been on MyNEARWallet, since achieving that allows us to work backwards and ensure the rest work. I suspect I've missed a lot in the wallet side of this monorepo at the time of this writing. Good to keep in mind, and not worry that you're "doing something wrong" if you see an issue. ;)

## alpha version

The focus thus far has been of a highly technical nature, and after releasing this alpha version the devs will let their minds gestate. then this file will fill out with more meaningful info and snippets. üôèüèº
